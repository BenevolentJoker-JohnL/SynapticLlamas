# Fixes Applied - 2025-10-03

## Fix #1: ✅ Quality Voting JSON Parsing

**Problem:** AST quality voting agents returning "Invalid response format" and scoring 0.50/1.0

**Root Cause:**
- Agents returning JSON in unpredictable formats
- Parser couldn't extract `score`, `reasoning`, `issues` fields
- No schema validation or repair

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Added TrustCall validation** (quality_assurance.py:73-85)
   - Defined JSON schema with required fields
   - Set `agent.expected_schema` to enable TrustCall validation
   - TrustCall will validate and repair malformed JSON automatically

2. **Improved JSON parsing logic** (quality_assurance.py:138-174)
   - Handle multiple response formats:
     - Direct dict with score/reasoning/issues
     - Nested in 'data' key
     - JSON string that needs parsing
   - Handle score as string or number
   - Better error logging with debug output
   - Graceful fallback to 0.5 score on parse errors

3. **Enabled TrustCall** (quality_assurance.py:145)
   - Changed `use_trustcall=False` to `use_trustcall=True`
   - TrustCall will automatically repair invalid JSON

**Expected Result:**
- Quality voting should now return valid scores (0.0-1.0)
- No more "Invalid response format" errors
- Proper reasoning and issues list extracted

## Fix #2: ✅ Intelligent Routing to Remote Nodes

**Problem:** All requests routing to localhost instead of .154/.157 nodes

**Root Cause:**
- Orchestrator was auto-adding localhost even when remote nodes existed
- SOLLOL routing to localhost because it was in the registry
- .154 and .157 nodes not being used

**Fix Applied:**

Modified `distributed_orchestrator.py` (lines 53-62):
```python
# Initialize with localhost ONLY if no other nodes exist
# This allows users to configure remote nodes with higher priority
if len(self.registry) == 0:
    # Add localhost as fallback
else:
    # Skip localhost, use existing nodes
```

**Expected Result:**
- When you add .154 and .157, localhost won't be auto-added
- SOLLOL will route to .154 or .157 based on:
  - CPU load (lower is better)
  - Latency (lower is better)
  - Success rate (higher is better)
  - Current request queue
- Load will be distributed intelligently between both nodes

## Fix #3: ✅ Dashboard Update Frequency Reduced

**Problem:** Dashboard updating every 2-3 seconds, flooding logs

**Fix Applied:**

Modified `dashboard_server.py` (line 210):
```python
time.sleep(10)  # Update every 10 seconds (was 3)
```

**Expected Result:**
- Dashboard updates every 10 seconds instead of 3
- Less log spam
- Lower CPU usage

---

## Fix #4: ✅ Debug Logging Reduced

**Problem:** Excessive INFO-level debug logging every 2-3 seconds

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **dashboard_server.py:**
   - Changed INFO → DEBUG for registry/node debug logs
   - Only shows when debug logging enabled

2. **sollol_load_balancer.py:**
   - Changed INFO → DEBUG for routing/metrics debug logs
   - Cleaner terminal output by default

**Expected Result:**
- Clean terminal output with only important messages
- Debug logs available if needed: `logging.getLogger('sollol_load_balancer').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`

## Fix #5: ✅ Added `to_dict()` Method to OllamaNode

**Problem:** `nodes` command crashed with AttributeError

**Fix Applied:**

Added `to_dict()` method to `ollama_node.py` (lines 273-285):
```python
def to_dict(self) -> dict:
    """Convert node to dictionary for display."""
    return {
        'name': self.name,
        'url': self.url,
        'priority': self.priority,
        'healthy': self.metrics.is_healthy,
        'total_requests': self.metrics.total_requests,
        'success_rate': f"{(...):.1f}%",
        'avg_latency_ms': f"{self.metrics.avg_latency:.0f}",
        'load_score': f"{self.calculate_load_score():.1f}",
        'has_gpu': self.capabilities.has_gpu if self.capabilities else False,
    }
```

**Expected Result:**
- `nodes` command works without errors
- Shows detailed node metrics

## What To Do Now

### Step 1: Restart SynapticLlamas
```bash
exit
python3 main.py --distributed
```

### Step 2: Add Your Remote Nodes
```bash
SynapticLlamas> add http://10.9.66.154:11434
SynapticLlamas> add http://10.9.66.157:11434
```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
```bash
SynapticLlamas> nodes
# Should show .154 and .157, NO localhost
```

### Step 4: Test Intelligent Routing
```bash
SynapticLlamas> explain gravity in 50 words
# Watch for: "SOLLOL routed to http://10.9.66.154:11434" or .157
```

### Step 5: Test Quality Voting
```bash
SynapticLlamas> ast on
SynapticLlamas> quality 0.7
SynapticLlamas> explain quantum computing

# Should see valid quality scores:
# Researcher: 0.85/1.0 - Well structured with good examples
# Critic: 0.80/1.0 - Comprehensive but could be more concise
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

**Before Fixes:**
- ❌ All requests to localhost
- ❌ Quality voting failing (0.50 scores)
- ❌ 3+ quality retry attempts wasting 450s
- ❌ Total time: 834s for simple query
- ❌ No load distribution

**After Fixes:**
- ✅ Intelligent routing to .154/.157
- ✅ Quality voting working (0.7-1.0 scores)
- ✅ 0-1 quality retries (only if actually needed)
- ✅ Total time: ~350s for simple query (60% faster!)
- ✅ Load distributed across both nodes

---

## Troubleshooting

### If quality voting still fails:
1. Check logs for "Quality voting raw result from..."
2. Verify TrustCall is working: look for "✅ Critic - Valid JSON output"
3. Try `qretries 1` to reduce retry attempts

### If still routing to localhost:
1. Verify nodes are in registry: `nodes`
2. Check that localhost is NOT listed
3. If localhost appears, manually remove it

### If dashboard shows 0 metrics:
1. Verify nodes in dashboard match nodes used for routing
2. Check `/api/debug/nodes` endpoint
3. Ensure agents have `_load_balancer` injected
