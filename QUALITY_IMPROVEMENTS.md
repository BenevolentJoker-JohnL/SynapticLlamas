# Quality Improvements - SynapticLlamas

## Summary of Changes

Fixed 5 critical issues causing poor output quality (repetitive, broken formatting, excessive length, slow execution).

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Editor Prompt** (`agents/editor.py`)
**Before:**
- Requested 2000-2500 words minimum
- "PRESERVE ALL CONTENT" → encouraged repetition
- "DO NOT remove content just because it seems repetitive"

**After:**
- Target 500-800 words (quality over quantity)
- "Eliminate redundancy while preserving key information"
- "Avoid repetition - explain each concept once clearly"
- Explicit LaTeX formatting guidance

**Impact:** Reduces rambling from ~14K chars to ~5K chars, clearer structure

---

### 2. **Quality Voting Criteria** (`quality_assurance.py`)
**Added:**
- Check for repetitive content
- Check for excessive length/rambling
- Check for broken math formatting (rac, \dotdot, etc.)
- Deduct points for wall of text without structure

**Impact:** Catches quality issues that agents were missing

---

### 3. **Output Validators** (NEW: `output_validators.py`)
Fast rule-based checks that run BEFORE quality voting:

**Repetition Check:**
- Detects duplicate sentences
- Flags repeated phrases (3+ words repeated 3+ times)
- Threshold: 30% max repetition

**Length Check:**
- Min: 100 words (too short)
- Max: 1500 words (rambling)

**Formatting Check:**
- Broken LaTeX: `rac{`, `sqrt{`, `\dotdot`
- Incomplete brackets: `|ψ` without `⟩`
- Missing backslashes in math notation

**Impact:** Catches obvious problems in <1s without LLM calls

---

### 4. **Workflow Integration** (`collaborative_workflow.py`)
**New Phase 4.5: Fast Validation**
- Runs validators after synthesis, before quality voting
- If validation score < 0.5 → immediate refinement
- Passes validation issues to editor for targeted fixes

**Workflow:**
```
Phase 1: Research
Phase 2: Critique
Phase 3: Refinement (optional)
Phase 4: Synthesis
Phase 4.5: Fast Validation ← NEW
Phase 5: Quality Voting (if enabled)
```

**Impact:** Catches bad output early, saves time on quality voting retries

---

## Expected Improvements

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Length** | 14K chars (rambling) | 5K chars (concise) |
| **Repetition** | High (same concepts restated) | Low (explain once) |
| **Math Formatting** | Broken (`rac`, `\dotdot`) | Clean (`\frac`, `\dots`) |
| **Structure** | Wall of text | Organized sections |
| **Speed** | 863s (14 min) | ~300s* (5 min) |

*Speed improvement depends on model/network, but shorter outputs = faster generation

## How to Test

### Quick Test (No AST Voting)
```bash
cd /home/joker/SynapticLlamas
python main.py
```

In the interactive prompt:
```
collab on
refine 1
Explain quantum entanglement
```

**Expected:**
- Output: ~500-800 words
- No repetition
- Proper LaTeX formatting
- Clear structure

---

### Full Test (With Validation + AST Voting)
```bash
python main.py
```

In the interactive prompt:
```
collab on
ast on
quality 0.7
Explain quantum entanglement
```

**You should see:**
```
Phase 4.5: Fast Output Validation
✅ Output validation PASSED (3/3 checks)

Phase 5: AST Quality Voting
✅ Quality voting PASSED - 0.85/0.70
```

---

## Configuration Recommendations

For best quality:

```
collab on           # Enable collaborative workflow
refine 1            # 1 refinement round (good balance)
ast on              # Enable quality voting
quality 0.7         # 70% threshold
timeout 300         # 5 min timeout per phase
```

For speed over quality:
```
collab on
refine 0            # No refinement
ast off             # Skip quality voting (rely on validators)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still getting repetitive output?
1. Check model: `llama3.2:3b` is very small, try `llama3.1:8b` or larger
2. Lower quality threshold: `quality 0.6` (less strict)
3. Check validator output in logs

### Broken LaTeX still appearing?
1. Validators should catch this in Phase 4.5
2. Check logs for "Output validation failed"
3. If validators pass but LaTeX broken → model issue, use larger model

### Still too long?
1. Check editor prompt in `agents/editor.py` line 35
2. Adjust max_words in validators: edit `output_validators.py` line 77

---

## Files Modified

1. `agents/editor.py` - Synthesis prompt
2. `quality_assurance.py` - Quality voting criteria
3. `collaborative_workflow.py` - Added validation phase
4. `output_validators.py` - NEW validator module

## Files Created

1. `output_validators.py` - Fast rule-based quality checks
2. `QUALITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - This document

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Model Upgrade**: Use larger synthesis model
   ```
   synthesis llama3.1:70b
   ```

2. **Custom Validators**: Add domain-specific checks in `output_validators.py`

3. **Stricter Thresholds**:
   ```python
   # In output_validators.py
   check_repetition(text, threshold=0.2)  # Lower = stricter
   check_length(text, max_words=1000)     # Lower = more concise
   ```

4. **Speed Optimization**:
   - Use local Ollama instead of distributed for small models
   - Disable AST voting (validators are fast enough)
   - Reduce refinement rounds

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check logs for validation failures
2. Verify model availability: `ollama list`
3. Test with smaller query first
4. Share validation output from logs
